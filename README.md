# basic-FNE

Basic code for generating the Full-Network Embedding, as introduced in [1].

Code consists of a general full_network_embedding method, which allows to extract the FNE of a list of images given a pre-trained model.
Additionally, the main code shows an example of use by using a pre-trained model provided by the tensorflow.lucid package.
